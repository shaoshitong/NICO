## Introduction

ü§ó We achieved third place üèÜ in the 2022 NICO Common Context Generalization Challenge (ECCV 2022 Workshop), and the related code will be released here.

## Datasets:

(NICO++)[https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08040]

### downloads:

The released data (for NICO challenge) is available:

You can also free to use NICO++ data for your research for non-economic purpose.

### The most important thing you should pay attention to is:

## How to train track1 dataset immediately?

### 1. Create your environment for training
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
source activate nico-mcislab840 # in [Linux] , activate nico-mcislab840 # in [Window]
```
### 2. Modify train_image_path, label2id_path, and test_image_path in track1_run.sh

### 3. Run ensemble_track1_run.sh for ensemble, and then get three final checkpoints: `track_1_pth_1.pth`, `track_1_pth_2.pth`, `track_1_pth_3.pth`

```bash
chmod 777 ensemble_track1_run.sh
bash ensemble_track1_run.sh
```

## How to test track1 dataset immediately?

### 1. Modify test_image_path, label2id_path, and test_pth_path in test.sh

### 2. Run test.sh for Test Time Augmentation (a longer period of time is required).

```bash
chmod 777 test.sh
bash test.sh
```

### 3. The voting method is applied for the final prediction (final_prediction.json)
```bash
python ensemble.py --ensemble_path predictionnico1 --save_path final_prediction.json
```
